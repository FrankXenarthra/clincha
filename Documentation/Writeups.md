# Writeups
I need to sort out the documentation in the repository and write up some things that have happened. 

## What's happened?
- Landlordin
	- Documentation on what needed done to get from a flat to ready for Airbnb
- Servers
	- A hub for documentation around the servers
	- Replacing HDD
	- Setting up RAID
	- Proxmox install
	- Work done with Packer
	- Work done with Terraform
	- Deciding on how to go from zero to back up and running
		- Do I have a local Packer build that can connect?
		- Should Packer be able to run in the cloud?
			- That would be a cool tool to make
			- You provide the config and it downloads the base ISO, connects to your hypervisor
