# Server Refresh 2022

I want a

- Quiet
- Globally distributed
- Connected (VPN)
- Monitored

network of computers.

## Objectives

### Quiet

The servers in Bristol have been keeping mum awake when she gets up. We can either improve the server closet or quieten
the servers.

#### Server cabinet noise dampening

- Rubber mat install
- Fill holes in wall
- Keep external fan on to reduce heat

#### New hardware

New consumer level hardware with enthusiast fans should be quieter and run cooler.

### Monitored

- Power consumption
- Active/Dead
- Temp
- Cameras

## Process

### Order

The storage class of servers will have the following configuration.

| Component                           | Price  | Quantity | Type        |
|-------------------------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| ASUS PRIME B450M-A II               | Bundle | -        | Motherboard |
| Corsair Vengeance LPX Black         | Bundle | -        | RAM         |
| AMD Wraith Stealth CPU cooler       | Bundle | -        | CPU cooler  |
| AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5                        | Bundle | -        | CPU         |
| Bundle                              | 359.99 | 1        | Bundle      |
| 128GB Gigabyte, M.2 NVMe SSD        | 21.98  | 1        | SSD         |
| 120GB Gigabyte SSD                  | 19.49  | 2        | SSD         |
| Seagate BarraCuda 4TB 3.5" SATA HDD | 73.79  | 3        | HDD         | 
| SATA III Cable, Male to Male        | 0.98   | 5        | Cable       |
| 450W Cooler Master 450 Bronze PSU   | 29.99  | 1        | PSU         |
| 120mm Noctua NF-S12B-REDUX-1200     | 13.99  | 2        | Case fan    |
| 80mm Noctua NF-A8                   | 15.98  | 2        | Case fan    | 
| 4U Standard Chassis                 | 85.74  | 1        | Case        | 

For this refresh, one server will be built with all these components. Two additional servers will be built but without
the hard drives. These will be salvaged from the servers that these replace. The total costs are outlined below.

| Server   | Cost    |
|----------|---------|
| EDI-S-01 | 817.9   |
| BRI-S-01 | 618.29  |
| BRI-S-02 | 618.29  |
| Total    | 2054.48 |

The plan is to recoup some of these costs by selling the existing servers. However, these servers are now old and I do not expect to get much back from them.
