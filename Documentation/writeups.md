# Writeups
I need to sort out the documentation in the repository and write up some things that have happened. Possible sections could be: bits, my little cloud, applications, being a landlord. These also need to be in a bunch of different repos. No point putting them all in here 

## Content that still needs writing
### What's happened?
- Landlordin
	- Documentation on what needed done to get from a flat to ready for Airbnb
	- Creating the server cabinet
- Servers
	- Replacing HDD
	- Setting up RAID
	- Proxmox install
	- Work done with Packer
	- Work done with Terraform

### Things that should happen
- Deciding on how to go from zero to back up and running
	- Do I have a local Packer build that can connect?
	- Should Packer be able to run in the cloud?
		- That would be a cool tool to make
		- You provide the config and it downloads the base ISO, connects to your hypervisor and away you go
- Kubernetes cluster
- Creating the Finance application
- Section for ideas that I've had
